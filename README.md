# How the game is built
- Each tetromino shape is hard coded as a matrix of 0's and #'s. This allows dynamic rotation by rotating the matrix 90 degrees.
- #'s in the tetromino's matrix is a random number between 1-5 that maps to a color. Source: /src/components/model/index.js
- Shapes are built using CSS positioned absolute.
- Action thunks are used to lay out the logic of drop timer.
- Reducers are only used to return the current shape's state and grid after clearing lines.
